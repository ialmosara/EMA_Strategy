# EMA Strategy
## About
This app is developed by Immanuel Almosara (ialmosara) and Amitpal Gill (Amit97-ops). The idea behind this app is to utilize the 9, 21, and 55 EMA (Exponential Moving Average) to generate buying and selling signals.

## Technolgies used
The technologies used in this project include: Python, Alpaca API

## Signal Rules
If the 9 EMA crosses above the 21 and 55 EMA then it will trigger a buy signal.

If the price closes below the 9 EMA it triggers a sell signal.
